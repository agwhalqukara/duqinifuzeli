However, she has previously been linked to many celebs in the past. Well, here’s a list.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Obliterated</strong></a> is a booze-soaked actionfest and one of <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>‘s most recent popular shows, debuting in the overall Top 10 shortly after its November 30 premiere. It’s a comedy-action drama that follows a group of highly trained individuals tasked with defending Las Vegas from a nuclear attack.</p><p>The fact that the entire tale takes place over the space of about twenty-four hours, during which the team makes some game-changing insights that put a lot of things into perspective, emphasizes the urgency of their task.</p><p><strong>Shelley Hennig</strong>, who plays the role lead role of Ava Winters, has been getting a lot of attention ever since the show was released on the streaming platform. Of course, a lot of people are interested in her personal life, especially her dating status. In this article, we’ll be discussing whether or not she has a boyfriend in 2023.</p><h2>Shelley Hennig Does Not Appear to Have a Boyfriend in 2023!</h2><p><strong>Shelley Hennig </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@shelleyhennig</a>) is one of those actors who don’t really prefer to share their personal life with the public. Even though she is in her mid-30s, beautiful, and all set to have a family, there is no confirmation on whether or not she has a boyfriend as of 2023.</p><p>You read it right. The Ava Winters actress does not appear to be in a relationship at the moment, not that we are aware of at least. We went through her Instagram and found absolutely nothing about her possible romance.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/12/shelley-hennig-boyfriend-2023.jpg alt="Shelley Hennig does not have a boyfriend at the moment. blurred-reality.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Shelley Hennig does not have a boyfriend at the moment.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>As a result, it is safe to assume that Shelley is single right now and focused on her career. While we agree that she is already 36 years old, we also believe that one should not rush to find a partner because of their age. Your partner determines how you’ll live for the rest of your life. So it’s important to take time and choose the correct partner.</p><p>On the other hand, there’s a chance Shelley Hennig already has a boyfriend but does not want to reveal it to the public. As mentioned earlier, she lives a very secretive life. Not every famous personality wants to share their dating life with the public. Thus, we wouldn’t be surprised if she and her possible boyfriend tie the knot without letting anybody know in the coming days.</p><p>It’s all rumors and speculations until Shelley herself reveals if she has a boyfriend. The given info is solely based on our speculation. However, we promise we will get back to you as soon as we get any information about her possible partner.</p><h2>Shelley Hennig’s Boyfriend List: A Look at Her Dating History!</h2><p>Talking about<strong> Shelley Hennig</strong>‘s <a href=# rel=noopener>dating history</a>, she was previously in a relationship with her Days of Our Lives co-star,<strong> Jay Kenneth Johnson</strong>., who played the role of Philip Kiriakis in the show. The two dated each other for five years.</p><p>It was Hennig’s first expressive meeting. They met on the show’s set. The couple began dating in 2007 and split up in 2011, after five years of being together. Shelley’s affair with Jay was not a private matter. They were spotted together multiple times.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/12/shelley-hennig-dating-history.jpg alt="Shelley Hennig and Jay Kenneth dated from 2007 to 2011. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Shelley Hennig and Jay Kenneth dated from 2007 to 2011.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Getty</strong></p><p>As a result, their relationship was confirmed by the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the duo never responded to the rumors. They were even spotted together in 2009 at the 36th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they were not destined to be together.</p><p>Shelley Hennig was later linked to another rumor. She was rumored to be dating <strong>Ben Mckenzie</strong>. Their relationship rumors first arose in 2013. However, neither of them provided confirmation. The list does not end here though.</p><p>She was also rumored to be dating <strong>Thomas Dekker</strong>. This, too, was rejected. It was nothing more than a bluff. As a result, we can say that she has not had significant relationships after Jay Kenneth.</p><p>Obliterated is now <a href=# rel=noopener>streaming</a> on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKuYmrmtsdhmn56mnp60bq7Osp2roZWjsXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./do-carrots-take-longer-to-cook-than-potatoes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do carrots take longer to cook than potatoes?">&larr;
