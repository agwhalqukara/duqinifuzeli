Before his funeral service on October 25 at Baltimore’s New Psalmist Baptist Church, where he was a member for 40 years, Cummings lay in state at the U.S. Capitol Building’s Statuary Hall on October 24. Prior to his death, the most recent people to lie in the state were former President George H. W. Bush in December 2018 and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.</p><p>Following a state funeral which was attended by family and members of Congress, thousands of public mourners were seen entering the U.S. Capitol to see his casket and received greetings from his widow, Maya Rockeymoore-Cummings. His casket departed from the U.S. Capitol at around 8:35 pm. On October 25, 2019, the official funeral for Cummings was at the New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore. This included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, along with Nancy Pelosi, John Lewis, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Elijah Cummings graduated with honors from the Baltimore City College high school in 1969. He then attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he served in the student government as sophomore class president, student government treasurer, and later student government president. He became a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science. Cummings graduated from law school at the University of Maryland School of Law, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1976. He admitted to the bar in Maryland later that year. Moreover, he practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the House in the 1996 elections.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>For 14 years, Elijah Cummings served in the Maryland House of Delegates. His predecessor, Lena King Lee, raised funds and campaigned for him; years later, Cummings credited her with launching his political career. In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. He was the first African American in Maryland history to be the Speaker Pro Tempore. Also, the second-highest position in the House of Delegates. Cummings also served on several boards and commissions, both in and out of Baltimore. Those include SEED Schools of Maryland Board of Directors and the University of Maryland Law School Board of Advisors.</p><p>He served on numerous Maryland boards and commissions including the Board of Visitors to the United States Naval Academy and the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel.

Cummings was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.</p><p>He served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 108th United States Congress. Cummings received praise following the congressional panel hearings on steroids in 2008. While investigating the use of steroids in sports, the panel called numerous baseball players to testify, including former single-season home run record holder Mark McGwire. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was “taking the Fifth”, referring to the Fifth Amendment. McGwire responded by saying, “I am here to talk about the future, not about the past.” The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.</p><h4><span>More about his career</span></h4><p>Cummings introduced the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, a bipartisan bill signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in December 2014. The bill, which Cummings co-sponsored with Representative Darrell Issa, (R-California), is a set of amendments to the Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.</p><p>He supported the Smart Savings Act, a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target-date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).&nbsp; Cummings called the bill a “commonsense change” and argued that the bill “will enable workers to take full advantage of a diversified fund designed to yield higher returns”. He introduced the All Circuit Review Extension Act.</p><p>A bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any U.S. circuit court of appeals, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has “an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases”. In remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Cummings declared: “Our party does not just believe, but understands, that Black Lives Matter. But we also recognize that our community and our law enforcement work best when they work together.”</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elijah-Cummings-giving-a-speech.jpg alt="Elijah Cummings" width=650 height=517 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-65628 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Elijah Cummings giving a speech (Source: Instagram)</p><h4>Awards and Nomination</h4><p>He was awarded many honors and awards in recognition of his political career.
