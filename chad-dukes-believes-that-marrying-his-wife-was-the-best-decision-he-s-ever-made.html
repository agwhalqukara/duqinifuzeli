On rare occasions, however, the RJ shares a few details about his mistress on his social media account. In one of these posts, Dukes stated that marrying his wife was his best decision.</p><h2>Best Decision I’ve Ever Made</h2><p><strong>On July 21, 2018, RJ celebrated his sixth wedding anniversary</strong> with an adorable Instagram post. The post showed a pair of prominent but unusual wedding bands on either of the couple’s ring fingers. While in the captions, Dukes reflected on how, six years ago, on that very day, he exchanged vows with the love of his life in a small house in Fairfax with an alligator head on the front porch.</p><p>RJ was clearly in a sharing mood as he elaborated that they drove to Blue Ridge Seafood for lunch with their respective brothers after the wedding. Closing the captions, the ecstatic husband admitted that marrying his wife was the best decision he’d ever made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wjfkfm-show-chaddukesvstheworld-775x515-1.jpg><p>This post revealed that the couple married on July 21, 2012, and the RJ has tagged their Commonwealth Dry Goods store in this photo. According to sources, his wife’s name is Daisy, and the couple has been dating since they were very young, according to one of his tweets, which has since been deleted.</p><h2>The Beginnings of ‘The Chad Dukes Show’</h2><p>Dukes, who has over 15 years of radio experience and millions of fans around the world, has finally decided to launch his website. After being accused of making racist remarks, the RJ was fired from 106.7 The Fan in October 2020. Currently, no information is available about the specific statement that led to Dukes’ dismissal. People on Twitter and Reddit, however, have speculated that Duke’s remark about racial-justice protests and how the NFL handled it is what got him fired.</p><p>The radio personality currently hosts his radio podcast, The Chad Dukes Show. The podcast, which debuted on January 1, 2021, covers a wide range of topics, including movies, food, football, fighting, video games, and much more.</p><p>Dukes’ website includes a collection of his free weekly episodes as well as the option of premium membership for $12.99 per month. His fans can access his daily premium episodes through the premium membership option.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZmUYrG2t8SsZKaZoqe2orPEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dak-prescott-tua-tagovailoa-other-nfl-qbs-who-should-be-on-hot-seat-entering-2024-news-scores.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dak Prescott, Tua Tagovailoa, Other NFL QBs Who Should Be on Hot Seat Entering 2024 | News, Scores, ">&larr;
