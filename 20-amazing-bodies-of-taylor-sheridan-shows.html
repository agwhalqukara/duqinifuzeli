In it, she shared some of her favorite exercises. Reilly says that 8 am, she does, "A long dog walk along the beach. I love hiking and horse-riding, and do yoga occasionally (I'm no Gwyneth Paltrow), more for my mind than anything else."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_1389368078.jpg><p><span>Piper Perabo plays Summer Higgins on </span><i><span>Yellowstone. </span></i><span>She shared some of her hair and skincare secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Into The Gloss.</span></a><span> "In my off time, I really go crazy low-maintenance. I rinse my hair with apple cider vinegar, and it takes all the product out. I'll stop dyeing my hair, and my roots come out.

Renner has to stay in shape to play that role, and shared some of his tips with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Men's Health</span></a><span>. "I'll take something called 'Liquid IV' which has potassium, and electrolytes and things like that.

"I think the root of empowerment is liking and accepting, all of yourself. From there, you can feel confident about who you are and what you bring to the table. Taking it a step further, you learn how to advocate for yourself and make better choices. Once you master that, you can extend that to advocating for others within your personal and professional community and the world at large. That's what empowerment means to me…so far. I'm sure I will expand on that as I get older and gain more life experience."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_732597832.jpg><p><span>Faith Hill played Margaret Dutton on the miniseries, </span><i><span>1883. </span></i><span>She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>New Beauty</span></a><span> that she and her husband, Tim McGraw, believe in having a strong work ethic, and have taught their daughters that. "It is very important to us as a family, and the girls have seen that. The one thing we stress is that you don't get things handed to you on a silver platter—you have to work for the things you want.

I will start from here.</span></p><p><span>I'm not big on looking back. I tend to look forward, to focus on tomorrow.

"Intimacy coordinators. That would have made a huge difference to my 90s. That is an extraordinary thing. We now have a number on our SAG card to call if we feel like something needs to be shared.

Before acting, Laird was modeling, and developed an eating disorder. She told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hungertv.com</span></a><span> that picking up acting helped her get through this. "I was in New York about five years ago, and I had a really bad eating disorder. I was slowly coming out of that and I gained a bit of weight, and then my agents told me to lose weight again. I was like, 'I can't do this any more,'" she recalls. "So then, in New York, and not able to get work because I was 'too fat', I had a minute to switch off. So I found this acting school and I went to an open day, and this guy said, 'Yeah there's a spot on this two-month course, but it starts tomorrow.' So I had to move out of this model apartment that day because I couldn't stay there any more. I've never really properly thought about this, or said this, but that acting course… That course really saved me. I went through some really awful shit in the modelling world around that time, and going to those classes and being able to fall in love with something really saved my life."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2233984275.jpg><p><span>Zoe Saldana plays the leading role of Joe on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She talked about how she approaches eating in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Byrdie</span></a><span>. "I try to be balanced. I don't like hearing, 'Oh, I'm doing this diet, or I'm doing that diet.' I like when people use words like 'my lifestyle.' When we use the word 'diet,' we're preparing ourselves for a big sacrifice that we know, the older we get, we're going to be too weak to fulfill. We just end up crashing and defeating ourselves. So I like telling myself that I'm not doing a diet, that this is my lifestyle, and I'm choosing to have a balanced meal. I don't like having zero carbs or all protein. I like getting all the nutrition that my body needs so that it can heal itself naturally."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1490395427.jpg><p><span>Jill Wagner plays Bobby on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She revealed some of the charities and causes she supports to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>My Devotional Thoughts</span></a><span>. "I support LLS-Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. They do so many good things to support people with cancer and help cure all blood cancers. I also love an organization called The Gentle Barn. The Gentle Barn rescues animals from severe abuse and neglect who are too old, sick, lame, or scared to be adopted into homes. We are a sanctuary to horses, donkeys, cows, pigs, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, llamas, peacocks, emus, cats and dogs. Once rehabilitated, the animals help us give hope and inspiration to children with the same stories."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2151361433.jpg><p><span>Nicole Kidman plays Kaitlyn Meade on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She shared some of her skincare secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Forbes</span></a><span>. Kidman revealed that sunscreen is a big part of her routine. "As someone with very fair skin, I'm very serious about sun protection and have been since I was a kid. I'm so grateful my parents were serious about sun protection when I was a child! Growing up in Australia, we spent so much time at the beach, my parents were always very serious about keeping my skin safe from the sun."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_797850739.jpg><p><span>Dave Annable played Lee Dutton on </span><i><span>Yellowstone</span></i><span>, and currently plays Neil on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>In an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Deadline</span></a><span>, he supported the strikes in the entertainment industry. "I'm part of the union and I'm happy to support the union. There are so many crew members and folks that are outta work, that are living paycheck to paycheck right now. It would be lovely to get back to work and get this industry moving again. That being said, it needs to be updated. Times change, things change. Obviously our whole business is changing. In the 20 years I've been doing this, it's sort of night and day how much it's changed. All of the deals need to reflect that.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/GettyImages-1670559523.jpg><p><span>Laysla De Oliveira plays Cruz Manuelos on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She shared how she got in shape for the role to</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> Toronto Life</span></a><span>. "I was lucky to work with a former Navy Seal named Jared Shaw who was basically responsible for turning me into a badass. Every day, we did an hour of strength training, an hour of weapons training and an hour of stunt training. Before that even started, I did hand-to-hand combat at this gym the studio sent me to in L.A. A lot of rappers go to the same gym, so I ended up training with Wiz Khalifa."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK5wLOgp59dl7yltcSsZKieXamuurjOq2SsoJWntqWtzWaqoaenYsC1rdGsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./country-singer-paisley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Country singer Paisley">&larr;
