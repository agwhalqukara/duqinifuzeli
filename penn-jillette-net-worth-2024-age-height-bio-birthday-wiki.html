According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Penn Jillette</b>'s net worth <strong>$200 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His graduation ceremony was at his school, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College in which he met Teller the future performer.</p><p align=justify>He is known for the red fingernail on his left hand. This started when his mother urged for him to make sure his fingers were clean.</p><p align=justify>Jillette was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts. His mother, Valda Rudolph Jillette (née Parks; 1909–2000), was a secretary, and his father, Samuel Herbert Jillette (1912–1999), worked at Greenfield’s Franklin County Jail. Jillette became an atheist in his early teens after reading the Bible. He was subsequently asked to leave the church, after asking questions in a youth group that purportedly also made skeptics of his peers. Jillette became disenchanted with traditional illusionist acts that presented the craft as authentic magic, such as The Amazing Kreskin on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist James Randi, and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious supernatural power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$200 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Magician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in the band Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob “Bob” Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a cappella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette’s movie commitments. They recorded an album with Kramer at Noise New York called Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here’s Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?). It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin Magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, “Oral Hygiene”.</p><p>Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central in the 1990s.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Penn Jillette height</b> <strong>6 ft 6 in</strong> Penn <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jillette served as host and presenter of the first touring performance by avant-garde band the Residents in 1983. The performance (titled The Mole Show and based on their “Mole trilogy” of albums) featured Jillette coming out between songs telling long and intentionally pointless stories. The show was designed to appear to fall apart as it progressed; Jillette pretended to grow angrier with the crowd, and lighting effects and music would become increasingly chaotic, all building up to the point where he was dragged off stage and returned, handcuffed to a wheelchair, to deliver his last monologue. During one performance, an audience member assaulted Jillette while he was handcuffed to the wheelchair. In later years, Jillette would contribute to two documentary films about the Residents.</p><p align=justify>In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the Las Vegas Valley and dubbed it “The Slammer”. It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside “The Slammer”. In 2016, he sold “The Slammer” so that his family could move to a less remote location.</p><h2>Who is Penn Jillette Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Penn Jillette</strong> married to <strong>Emily Zolten </strong>.
