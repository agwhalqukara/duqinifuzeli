She told her about the extramarital relationship she was having with her husband. Amy stated they had been dating since July 1991 and showed her a T-shirt belonging to Joey to prove the infidelity.</p><p class=align-left>Mary disbelieved and called her husband when Amy shot Mary's face with a 25 calibre semi-automatic pistol.
