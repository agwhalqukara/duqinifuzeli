Not even when they were married. She has accomplished a lot in her career and has moved on with her life since their divorce in April 2006.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Nicole Mitchell Murphy’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Nicole Ronnette Mitchell Murphy</li><li><b>Nickname:&nbsp;</b>Niki</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Female</li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>January 5, 1968</li><li><strong>Nicole Mitchell murphy’s Age:</strong> 55 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity:&nbsp;</b>African American and Caucasian</li><li><b>Nationality:&nbsp;</b>American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign:&nbsp;</b>Capricorn</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:&nbsp;</b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion:&nbsp;</b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:&nbsp;</b>Divorced</li><li><b>Nicole Mitchell Murphy’s Ex-Husband:&nbsp;</b>Eddi Murphy</li><li><strong>Nicole Mitchell Murphy’s Children:&nbsp;</strong>5</li><li><strong>Nicole Mitchell Murphy’s Parents: </strong>Ellen and Eddie T.

As such, she is 55 years old right now. The fashion model is seven years younger than her ex-husband, Eddie Murphy.&nbsp;Murphy was born in Brooklyn, New York on the 3rd of April 1961. He is 62 years old at the moment.</p><p>Nicole picked up an interest in modeling at an early age. By the time she turned 13, she was already landing gigs with popular brands. Soon enough, she bagged a spot in an international modeling competition and emerged as its winner. This earned her a modeling contract with a reputable modeling agency in Paris, Ford Modeling Agency.</p><h3><strong>Where is Nicole Murphy From?</strong></h3><p>Nicole Mitchell Murphy is a citizen of the United States of America from Sacramento, California. She was born and raised there but after she landed a modeling contract with Ford Modeling Agency, she relocated to Europe for work and live there for nearly a decade.</p><p>Nicole is an American national of mixed ethnic heritage, thanks to her parents. She has both European and African ancestry. Her father, Eddie T. Mitchell, is African-American while her mother, Ellen Mitchell, who passed on the 4th of November 2019, was an English woman. The model was raised in what one might describe as a conventional middle-class family.</p><p>Her father was an officer of the United States Air Force. Ellen supported him in providing for the family but mostly dedicated her time to caring for her kids. Apart from Nicole, the couple had three other children, Trevor, Nathan, and Darius. So Nicole has three siblings, all brothers. Her parents divorced when she was little. After this, she and her siblings lived with their mother until their parents reconciled and got married again.</p><h2><strong>Nicole Mitchell Murphy and Eddie Murphy Met in 1988 and Got Married in 1993</strong></h2><p>The love story of the former couple began at the NAACP Image Award show of 1988. According to reports, they met at the event, got acquainted, and exchanged numbers. They kept in touch with each other, became friends, and it soon turned into a romantic relationship. Almost as soon as it was obvious they were dating, they moved into an apartment together.</p><p>Given that they lived together for about two years, it was only natural that people began speculating that they were working toward getting married. This proved to be true when it emerged that they were engaged. Shortly afterward, they got married. Nicole and the stand-up comedian exchanged vows on the 18th of March 1993. The event took place at the Grand Ballroom of The Plaza Hotel in New York City.</p><p>Things went well for them for several years but along the line, they started having friction. Unfortunately, it became unbearable for Nicole and she filed for divorce in August 2005 citing irreconcilable differences. This set the motion for their marriage to come to an end. Eventually, they finalized their divorce on the 27th of April 2006 after 13 years of marriage.</p><h3><strong>She Had All of Her Five Kids With the Famous Hollywood Star&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Nicole Mitchell Murphy had a total of five children with her ex-husband Eddie Murphy. She is a mother of four daughters and one son. Her son’s name is Myles Murphy while her daughters are Bria L. Murphy, Shayne Audra Murphy, Zola Ivy Murphy, and Bella Zahra Murphy.</p><p>Bria L. Murphy is the oldest of her children, she was born on the 18th of November 1989, before Nicole got married to Eddie. So she is 34 years old at the moment. About a year before Nicole’s marriage to Eddie, they welcomed their second child and only son, Myles Murphy. Born on the 7th of November 1992, he is currently 31 years old.</p><p>Her third child and second daughter, Shayne Audra Murphy, was born on the 10th of October 1994 and is currently 29 years old. After her came Zola Ivy Murphy and then Bella Zahra Murphy. They were respectively born on December 24, 1999, and January 29, 2002, this makes them 24 and 21 right now.</p><h2><strong>Who is Eddie Murphy’s Ex-Wife With?</strong></h2><p>It is not known if Eddie Murphy’s ex-wife is in a relationship with anyone at the moment. In mid-June 2022, she made news headlines after she was seen hanging out with a mystery man. The identity of the man remains unknown to the public just as it is hard to tell if the former model is dating anyone.</p><p>Since the end of her marriage to Eddie Murphy, Nicole Mitchell Murphy has been romantically linked to several popular men. Just after her divorce, sometime in 2007, she was seen in Mexico with NBA legend, Michael Jordan, but none of them confirmed that they were dating. That same year, she began a relationship that lasted for many years with former NFL star, Michael Strahan.</p><p>Nicole and the&nbsp;Good Morning America&nbsp;host dated until 2014 when they broke up over <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>claims that Strahan cheated on her</a>. Later in 2019, Nicole herself was involved in a cheating scandal. She was photographed kissing Antoine Fuqua in public. No one would have had any problem with that but the director has a wife.</p><p>Fuqua had been married to actress<span class=w8qArf>&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Lela Rochon</span> since 1999. Similarly, actress LisaRaye McCoy once accused Nicole of having an affair with her ex-husband, Michael Misick, while they were married. But the former model has insisted that it is not true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecSdm6KdXaLCs7zHsqpmnahixKqyxGalopufobJuucitmqGdnKF6rsHRqZ%2ByZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gigi-hadid-finally-debuts-her-bare-baby-bump-on-camera.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gigi Hadid Finally Debuts Her Bare Baby Bump On Camera!">&larr;
